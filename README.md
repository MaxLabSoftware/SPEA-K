SPEA-K is a freely available MATLAB program that allows users with or without programming experience to test children in speech experiments with auditory feedback perturbations. This is achieved by (a) letting the user configure all details of the experimental manipulations and elicited speech utterances in a graphical user interface (GUI) and storing the selected settings in experiment configuration files, (b) eliciting speech from the child during an interactive “board game” designed to run on a touchscreen monitor, and (c) implementing auditory feedback manipulations of the child’s speech with the freely available Audapter MATLAB program previously developed by Shanqing Cai and others.  

SPEA-K is used to design and administer the experiment, but is currently not optimized to analyze the obtained data. Nevertheless, the results of Audapter’s online formant and fundamental frequency tracking (i.e., Audapter’s own real-time acoustic measures of the participant’s speech) are available to the experimenter after the session. For final data preparation, we recommend additional, rigorous acoustic analyses and visual inspection of all individual tokens. 

Although the user interacts only with SPEA-K – while Audapter runs all data acquisition and processing “under the hood” – we strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with the technical details of Audapter itself if possible. A manual for Audapter is available at http://sites.bu.edu/guentherlab/files/2016/11/AudapterManual.pdf. The manual for SPEA-K itself is available here with the code.
